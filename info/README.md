## Description

*Twenty ways to think about a snake! Is it an alarmist?! A nudist?! A conformist?! Crossing tasks off its checklist!? Or just doing the twist!? You get the gist!*

*SNAKISTS* is a direct sequel to [*SNAKISMS*](https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISMS/info/). I thought it would be pretty fun to take on the variations challenge with Snake one more time. The world of ists is a weirder and less philosophical world than the isms, and so are the games. Heist, typist, ... onanist. You know you want to.

*SNAKISTS* was created using [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) along with [Hammer.js](https://hammerjs.github.io/) for touch gestures (swipes).
