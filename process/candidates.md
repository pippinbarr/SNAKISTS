# Candidates

Where I will list ists that I might actually use. These should at a minimum be visually prototyped, ideally for-real prototyped.

## Fist

As in Mario Odyssey's desert boss. A huge enemy made of wall pieces that moves around (this is also sounding a hell of a lot like my Shadow of the Colossus desnake), or maybe just its fists? And you're trying to get across to the side of punch it with your head - in the eye, most obviously? Which would of course have to be an apple?

Maybe there's stuff around K.O.s and health and so on for the Snake?

## Gist

The idea of a total distillation of Snake even more than it already is. A presentation of the game that's like "I get the gist". Which could also be temporal, like you eat one apple, another appear, and then it ends saying "you get the gist".

This almost functions as a meta-joke about the whole Snake series (and my work in general), that you engage enough to "get it" and probably move on. Gist games. Hehe.

## List

Visually I can imagine a series of snakes on rows (maybe starting next to bullet points actually) so that they look like a list. I think that's enough of a gag already, but it would need some more development I suppose... unclear what the end game is there?

Oh it could also be a to-do list where you are striking out the items, that's not terrible... though eating and striking-out may be a little far apart?

## Mist

Just the ol' fog of war applied to Snake. Probably want a more interesting terrain for that, though that starts to feel arbitrary? It's a tough combo having continual movement with a mist. How to make it look nice? Or do I not bother?

## Alist

A rare nautical term for a boat being on an angle. It's an easy one to imagine putting together (tilt the canvas? Tilt the tiles?), but the fact it's such an alien word may not help. It would work if there were a definition though, so not impossible. I need an official source for definitions.

## Deist

Because the definition I read specifically presents this as believe in a *non-interventionist god* (hi Nick Cave) I wonder if there's some juice to just having this be a Snake with no controls that moves across the screen (logically) and then hits the wall (dies).

## Feist

In terms of it being a word it's about a "small mongrel dog" apparently, which doesn't fit, but if we took it to be the singer then a "snake cover" of her song 1234 could make a ton of sense? Copyright a problem. Could I write to Feist and ask if I could cover her song as a game? One syllable/beat per tick? I can imagine some irregular movement patterns that could be really funny to see? (Though this mirrors what I thought early on for Tubist as well)

## Foist

The idea would be the game "foists" another snake on you (that you control) and that causes your play to be significantly harder.

There are a *lot* of -ists that have nothing to do with SNAKISMS which is both really funny and kind of stupid. Maybe stupid funny though? As the words get longer they'll get ISMier though I suppose?

## Heist

Just because heists are so game-like it would be fun to at least try to do this? Snake "breaks into" somewhere (how?? Eats the apple door?) Then in a confined space eats a bunch of green apples (money???) and then escapes... somehow? And little police walls come to chase you with sirens blaring???
