# Candidates

Where I will list ists that I might actually use. These should at a minimum be visually prototyped, ideally for-real prototyped.

## Fist

As in Mario Odyssey's desert boss. A huge enemy made of wall pieces that moves around (this is also sounding a hell of a lot like my Shadow of the Colossus desnake), or maybe just its fists? And you're trying to get across to the side of punch it with your head - in the eye, most obviously? Which would of course have to be an apple?

Maybe there's stuff around K.O.s and health and so on for the Snake?

## Gist

The idea of a total distillation of Snake even more than it already is. A presentation of the game that's like "I get the gist". Which could also be temporal, like you eat one apple, another appear, and then it ends saying "you get the gist".

This almost functions as a meta-joke about the whole Snake series (and my work in general), that you engage enough to "get it" and probably move on. Gist games. Hehe.

## List

Visually I can imagine a series of snakes on rows (maybe starting next to bullet points actually) so that they look like a list. I think that's enough of a gag already, but it would need some more development I suppose... unclear what the end game is there?

Oh it could also be a to-do list where you are striking out the items, that's not terrible... though eating and striking-out may be a little far apart?

## Mist

Just the ol' fog of war applied to Snake. Probably want a more interesting terrain for that, though that starts to feel arbitrary? It's a tough combo having continual movement with a mist. How to make it look nice? Or do I not bother?
