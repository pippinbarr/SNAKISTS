# Candidates

Where I will list ists that I might actually use. These should at a minimum be visually prototyped, ideally for-real prototyped.

## See: Twist ~~Alist~~

~~A rare nautical term for a boat being on an angle. It's an easy one to imagine putting together (tilt the canvas? Tilt the tiles?), but the fact it's such an alien word may not help. It would work if there were a definition though, so not impossible. I need an official source for definitions.~~

## Animist

So an animist believes that things have souls, including inanimate objects (so I suppose the walls would have souls too). My main design though in ists was to have it so that on "dying" both the snake and apple would have a soul (a lowered-alpha copy) leave their body and go upwards. Funny to think of that happening on the tick actually.

I do like this image a lot... I'm not sure how much I think it really captures what an Animist believes in though so I'll have to look further. I'd like to shoehorn this idea in there somewhere anyway.

## Artist

At the very least the obvious snake paints with body, probably in the sense of a paint duration based on the apple (=paint can). Of course I also literally did this in Art Game and in that case it was about strategic dying to create the artwork.

Definitely an opportunity to have an ending screen with a framed picture at the very least. There's some argument to mirror Art Game? There's a debate there anyway.

## Coexist

At its simplest interpretation let's say this involves two snakes, both controlled by the player, and thus both needing to coexist in the play space. Could involve some kind of "manners" around the apples as well, but I think mostly it would just be a nightmare not smacking into a wall.

If one Snake dies does the other carry on, or would it be proof they couldn't ... coexist?

(This wouldn't work on mobile because of the controls necessary.)

## Copyist

A person who makes copies is fun. If the Snake is a person who makes copies (well they kind of already copy units of their own body in a sense) then what would they copy? Themselves? The apple? The walls? Not many options!

The apple would of course lead to madness... so maybe that's fun.

## Cosmist

I mean it's pretty fun to think about the Cosmic destiny of the Snake... but less clear how we might represent that... immortality, control over nature, space exploration... considered as "stages" there might be something there? Like you collect apples to upgrade; first you get "immortality"? So walls no longer do anything (have admittedly already done that in SNAKISMS); then control over nature means you can maybe spawn an apple any time? Change the length of your body? (Mobile controls for this sound almost impossible) Then you can go to Space... maybe a starfield appears and you head up out of the screen to end the game?

## Cubist

I'm only including this because there's such a funny relationship between cubism and Snake. To some extent it feels like it makes it impossible, but I should read more (than an AI summary) about Cubism to remind me of its nature.

The idea that you could see different parts of the snake and thus, perhaps, its face (which I'm imagining is facing "forward" in the direction of movement) is very funny though maybe not funny enough.

## Dadaist

I don't currently know what this would be (how Dada), but I feel like it has to be in here (though as I think about it I'm now wondering if there's an "art movements" version of Snake to consider). 

At heart (see the notes lower down and also read more about Dada) it would be about absurdism and rejection of the warlike/capitalist/individualist/etc.ist nature of Snake (and videogames). That could amount to just insanity visually, could be messing with the code in uncontrolled ways (though we all know that will just crash the program - which is worth entertaining?), could be teleporting snake, random score, sound-track, collaging in photographs, ... hard to say for now, but the spirit of it would be RESISTING SNAKE'S OWN FORM IN ITS FORM I SUPPOSE

## **Prototyped** Deist

Because the definition I read specifically presents this as believe in a *non-interventionist god* (hi Nick Cave) I wonder if there's some juice to just having this be a Snake with no controls that moves across the screen (logically) and then hits the wall (dies).

## **Prototyped** Delist

Menu-only game. You select this item, the menu-snake eats it, and then it's gone and you just choose something else. *That* is funny.

## **Prototyped** Demist

Snake body demists the screen (only where it can reach though, so you might have the comedy of all the other stuff being blurred (ideally we have blur)). And that's it. Mist builds back up maybe over time so it's a constant battle of it being hard to see...

## Diarist

I love the thought of the Snake having a diary. Either pooping it out as it moves around (which would be quite a fun and strange reading experience? Maybe impossible as well...) // Or prompting the player to write diary entries at specific moments, maybe after they die? Die-ary ahaha, no.

## Duelist

Two Snakes enter, one Snake leaves? And that's it? Some of the more formal ideas around duels with seconds and pistols and dawn? Oh you could have to show up at dawn, that would be pretty funny.

This might actually be better for the sword fight than epeeist.

## Egoist / Egotist

This is in the school (I think) of versions where you just present Snake as is and are sort of pointing out that Snake *already* adheres to some value. The Snake is in some sense egoistic, only cares about itself and its apples...

I dunno. It's pretty dry.

## Elegist

The player writes an elegy for the Snake after it dies. Brilliant, but dependent on player buy-in which is tough.

## Elitist

Hmmm, maybe the game could quiz you about whether you're GOOD ENOUGH to control the snake and play? Qualifications check? How would we ask for proof? A quiz about your depth of Snake knowledge. Could actually get into a pretty fun and stupid gamerbro gamergate mockery session actually...

## Epeeist

Putting aside that this is a horrible looking word and not common enough to feel relatable it is a) still pretty easy to understand its meaning if you know what an epee is and b) pretty alluring as a design challenge - Snakes and Swords.

My immediate vision is two snakes each with a thin grey line sticking out of their face and pointed in the direction of movement. And you'd need to score a hit on the opponent's head... somehow. Because body simply wouldn't make sense? Or would it?? I don't even know. Easy to try both.

It just seems like one of those things that could be secretly fun and worth prototyping. BUT what about the fact of AI? There's no WAY I'm going to write a Snake-based sword-fighting AI. And making it multiplayer feels ridiculous... or rather it would be impossible on mobile but doable with WASD and ARROWS on desktop?

So not out of the realms of possibilty but some strikes against it.

See: Duellist as a better linguistic fit.

## Faddist

I don't *really* think this works but it deserves more thought so here it is. The idea of a version of snake that switches between multiple "faddish" ideas of design or aesthetics or... something. That it's kind of unable to make up its mind about its nature is quite fun...

## Feist

In terms of it being a word it's about a "small mongrel dog" apparently, which doesn't fit, but if we took it to be the singer then a "snake cover" of her song 1234 could make a ton of sense? Copyright a problem. Could I write to Feist and ask if I could cover her song as a game? One syllable/beat per tick? I can imagine some irregular movement patterns that could be really funny to see? (Though this mirrors what I thought early on for Tubist as well)

## Fist

As in Mario Odyssey's desert boss. A huge enemy made of wall pieces that moves around (this is also sounding a hell of a lot like my Shadow of the Colossus desnake), or maybe just its fists? And you're trying to get across to the side of punch it with your head - in the eye, most obviously? Which would of course have to be an apple?

Maybe there's stuff around K.O.s and health and so on for the Snake?

## Foist

The idea would be the game "foists" another snake on you (that you control) and that causes your play to be significantly harder.

There are a *lot* of -ists that have nothing to do with SNAKISMS which is both really funny and kind of stupid. Maybe stupid funny though? As the words get longer they'll get ISMier though I suppose?

## **Prototyped** Gist

The idea of a total distillation of Snake even more than it already is. A presentation of the game that's like "I get the gist". Which could also be temporal, like you eat one apple, another appear, and then it ends saying "you get the gist".

This almost functions as a meta-joke about the whole Snake series (and my work in general), that you engage enough to "get it" and probably move on. Gist games. Hehe.

## Heist

Just because heists are so game-like it would be fun to at least try to do this? Snake "breaks into" somewhere (how?? Eats the apple door?) Then in a confined space eats a bunch of green apples (money???) and then escapes... somehow? And little police walls come to chase you with sirens blaring???

## Jurist

I'm imagining a quiz setup where the snake eats an apple to answer (like red apple versus blue apple for A or B); and then the questions are about laws pertaining to snakes...? Hehe.

## List

Visually I can imagine a series of snakes on rows (maybe starting next to bullet points actually) so that they look like a list. I think that's enough of a gag already, but it would need some more development I suppose... unclear what the end game is there?

Oh it could also be a to-do list where you are striking out the items, that's not terrible... though eating and striking-out may be a little far apart?

## **Prototyped (as "demist")** Mist

Just the ol' fog of war applied to Snake. Probably want a more interesting terrain for that, though that starts to feel arbitrary? It's a tough combo having continual movement with a mist. How to make it look nice? Or do I not bother?

## Moist

Most basically leaving a pale blue trail because the snake is moist. But I dunno if that has much to recommend it?

## **Prototyped** Nudist

I made a pink snake but snakes are probably already nude? I'm wondering about the idea of the snake shedding its skin as a "more nude" snake? Constantly shedding its skin... kind of funny and is a sort of mechanic too, builds walls... or... well do you die if you hit a snake skin?

## Odist

I'm not really convinced, but some kind of poetry-writing mechanics folded into Snake is not totally hateable... maybe just multiple-choice apples that construct a poem? And the poem is an ode to snakes or apples or walls? Ehehehe, okay that's not terrible.

## **Prototyped** Purist

Just regular snake. I like this one. It's fun. And especially if I'm including dictionary definitions, e.g. "a person who insists on absolute adherence to traditional rules or structures, especially in language or style."

## Resist

Most obvious starting point is that the snake *resists* the player's attempt to control it. Not pure fatalism (as in SNAKISMS) but more a push and pull with the player's input.

## Sadist

The player would be the sadist right? How? We encourage them to be by scoring points for killing the snake, not for eating the apple. Smash them against the wall, themselves, over and over, for points. GAME OVER if you let them eat the apple?

## Tubist (or Tubaist)

Move to the tones of a tuba with that classic oompah rhythm that would change up the tick timing. Funny but also gameplay relevant.

See also: Feist.

## Twist

A possibly more clear version of *alist*? Twist the tiles and deal with the visual result? The tiles could "do the twist" while you play? Layer upon layer of bad jokes? Don't hate it... come on baby, let's do the twist?

## Typist

Clacking with each keypress. Snake moves on clack. Probably auto-snake so you're just driving its movement/the tick. Could pick funny texts to type I suppose?

Oooohhhh... or the whole screen could be mapped to letters and you type the letter adjacent to the head to go to that direction! That would be a weird feeling thing because a lot of the time it would *not* be about typing a sentence unless you were moving left to right? Might end up being weirdly wrong...

Can try both.
