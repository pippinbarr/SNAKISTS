# Ists

Wherein I list over 700 ists (list is an ist) and see what comes to mind. Might take a few rounds to get to every single one. These lists by length come, as you might imagine, from a [scrabble dictionary](https://scrabble.merriam.com/words/end-with/ist).

## Four letters (because this is Scrabble)

- cist
    - Well, disgusting obviously. Can a Snake snake have a cist? You pop them. You don't eat them. They can indicate that you're not well or they can be benign. It's also not an ist in the sense of ism, and I don't want *too* many of those
- fist
    - **CANDIDATE** Snake as a punch? I do kind of like that. Feels like a reference to the desert boss in Mario Odyssey? Punch-Out hybrid? I think this could be pretty fun. An enemy made of walls with an apple... for an eye? That you need to punch. Yeah.
    - This is admittedly not an ism-ist but on the other hand I could go all the way the other way with it I suppose... you *think* it's going to be a spiritual successor but then it isn't? Or just a blend. We'll have to see... there's an issue of comedy here, not quite timing but... something else... proportion...
- gist
    - You get the idea. This seems very vague. "the substance or essence of a speech or text." (via Google).
    - **CANDIDATE** Perhaps there's a way to simplify Snake even more so you just "get the gist" or it? That's not terrible
- hist
    - No idea what this means. "used to attract attention or call for silence." Archaic. Sure is. I think it's archaism (ahaha) probably disqualifies it. 
    - **DESIGN IDEA** Though this does raise the spectre of definitions somewhere in the chain of play?
- kist
    - Uh? "a chest used for storing clothes and linen." Scottish apparently. Hard to imagine using it.
- list
    - **CANDIDATE**  I know what a list is! I like the idea of a "list of snakes"? It could be like a horizontal-only version of the Tux and Fanny Snake game? It seems like vertical movement would be impossible though? Might be logistically wrong, even if a list of snakes is a very cool idea. Worth a prototype.
- mist
    - **CANDIDATE** This one screams fog of war to me, an easy yes for prototyping.
- wist
    - Archaic. "have knowledge." Down with archaisms.
