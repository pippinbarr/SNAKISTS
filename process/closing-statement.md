## Themes

### All the Snakes that are Snake

- Purist
- Nudist 
- Conservatist
- Individualist

> But now I realize the NUDIST could be the one that's just normal snake hehe. Though I also thought of PURIST for that... so I dunno...
https://github.com/pippinbarr/SNAKISTS/commit/1488e266b05feee33ab33031b83807c138f562fc

### In and out

How do you choose which ones are "good"?

> Obviously a lot of candidates won't make it because they are terrible
https://github.com/pippinbarr/SNAKISTS/commit/33500683d6d828b45427f0c7ac5d92593cabdcbd

### Ists ain't isms

> It's notable how many of the candidates are not ists in the sense of isms; almost like the whole game could be that
https://github.com/pippinbarr/SNAKISTS/commit/33500683d6d828b45427f0c7ac5d92593cabdcbd

### Design org

Ongoing theme of organizing my documents and thinking through how MDM works for this project

> - This session was helpful in that it includes design thinking in the new "prototypes" document where I'm reflecting specifically on prototyping work; but also the prototyping work itself
> - Is that a good thing, or not? It's nice that the commit has both at the same time maybe? A bit in conversation? Or would it have been better to do the work then reflect? Or reflect commit work commit reflect commit? I don't really know
> - Anyway, the act of prototyping and playing the real versions of a couple of these was really quite fun and made me happy, nice to switch from reading the dictionary for a bit

### Small language

The idea that Snake is such a circumscribed language of play that you can't just say ANYTHING. THere's something funny about how easy it was to do mega philosophical concepts, but so much harder to do more concrete IST stuff?

> I think I'm running into some "helpful difficulties" around the sheer limits of the Snake universe; because I'm mostly trying to think in terms of minimally additive stuff, but a lot of ISTS (and all words) are understandably so far removed from what Snake world represents that it would take adding a lot of stuff to close the gap; which I think may contradict something wrote earlier about Snake being some kind of primitive Ur-language, haha

### Meta implementations

> Persist was fun because one of the ideas revolves around a more meta-level interpretation of it, which I appreciate (in the vein of delist)

Ways of getting away from the hard limits of Snake-in-play

### Love the process 

> I'm loving, in this moment, that this project amounts to READING THE DICTIONARY and designing games based on words you find. So basic, so effective, such a nice commentary on game design and the affordances of design with a pre-established game/play language.
https://github.com/pippinbarr/SNAKISTS/commit/f8f4c757e5a56554ef53f852c73368e1940e2066

> - The snake dies on the first tick because the world is full of matter
> - I mean, this is the good life right here
> - Let's not ask ourselves too rigorously whether this is also the research life... I want to be amused
https://github.com/pippinbarr/SNAKISTS/commit/7a435771ede08136dd19f4e4413004aae268c144

(Not just in terms of this is a good process, but the value of happiness in design)

> Felt good to pop out three today just here and there, keep it rolling... slithering...
