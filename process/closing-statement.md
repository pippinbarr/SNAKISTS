# AMAZING TITLE

The [Method for Design Materialization](https://gamesasresearch.com) recommends that you write a "closing statement," or some kind of final "stop and think" about the design and development of the game you've been working on. So here we are.

I'm not going to try to be sophisticated about this, I've just spent some time with the repository reading through especially the commits and the different design documents. Here we go!

## Why?

> Why indeed?
>
> [`why.md`](https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISTS/process/why.html#:~:text=Why%3F-,Why%20indeed%3F)

I didn't manage to write any "whys" for this project, which is in itself probably quite revealing: it never felt like a project where I was trying to answer a question or really explore something brand new. Rather, it's a sequel to *SNAKISMS* that shares its basic concept of translating existing concepts (ists, isms) into a restricted gameplay language (snake).

That said, in my notes there's an acknowledgement of a kind of non-research why:

> What am I doing? I’m avoiding working on other projects like a “game poem” and also the next step along the way of the It is as if projects.
>
> [`journal.md`, 6 March 2025](https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISTS/process/journal.html#:~:text=What%20am%20I%20doing%3F%20I%E2%80%99m%20avoiding%20working%20on%20other%20projects%20like%20a%20%E2%80%9Cgame%20poem%E2%80%9D%20and%20also%20the%20next%20step%20along%20the%20way%20of%20the%20It%20is%20as%20if%20projects)

This sort of "emotional reason" is probably a huge part of why anyone makes any game, but it's maybe not always acknowledged or written down? Or at least I don't always write it down in favour of sounding like I've got a *proper research project* going on.

More than anything I think the key outcome, though, is that I *should* be working on the [`why.md`](./why.md) document in any project. If you're not thinking about why, you're missing an opportunity to understand the larger point. In this project, for instance, it's still important to *extend* my thinking about this project of exploring restricted gameplay languages as forms of expression.

## It's just Snake

One of the surprises of this whole project was an extension of an idea that had come up in *SNAKISMS*: creating a version of the game, based on a concept, that is just the game itself framed by that concept. So in *SNAKISMS* I made "Conservatism" which was literally just Snake itself, with the point being that the idea of Conservatism is being committed to traditional ways and values and avoiding/disliking change.

In that case the point was to make a joke about "variation games" in a sense, to say that the variation in that case just *is* the base game. But in *SNAKISMS* there was only *one* of these, and it was specific and intentional. What I found in *SNAKISTS* was that I ran into *multiple* -ists that could be reasonably said to correspond just to the base case of Snake, e.g.:

> But now I realize the NUDIST could be the one that's just normal snake hehe. Though I also thought of PURIST for that... so I dunno...

All snakes, including the Snake snake, are "nudists" because they don't wear clothes, but also that a "purist" version of Snake would be Snake as well. That's funny, but it led to some reflection on how this activity of thinking about -ists in relation to Snake was also a reflection on the underlying values of Snake itself, what kinds of cultural/political/social ideals it seems to embody (directly or metaphorically):

> The idea of -ists that end up just being Snake with no modifications. Purist, Nudist, Individualist, … – that’s both funny and kind of about the question of how you characterize underlying value or other systems of a game like Snake. Is Snake “fascist” in some way? Do videogames have inherent political or cultural alignments? It’s a pretty interesting question at the level of design? It might also be a (truly weird) kind of language/insight into why some forms of design are just harder than others? If Snake is a Fascist is it harder to create progressive revisions?

How do you choose which ones are "good"?

### Ists ain't isms

> One thing that I find fun here is that unlike ISM, the IST ends up with a bunch of words that are not about philosophical positions because IST is just a more common suffix (e.g. persist), and you also end up with kind of quite negative words (agist, fascist)… these are less abstract and more forceful? Maybe they’re harder or easier to turn into snakes?
https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISTS/process/journal.html#:~:text=One%20thing%20that,turn%20into%20snakes%3F

> It's notable how many of the candidates are not ists in the sense of isms; almost like the whole game could be that
https://github.com/pippinbarr/SNAKISTS/commit/33500683d6d828b45427f0c7ac5d92593cabdcbd

> With SNAKISMS the whole point was to channel -ism as a conduit to philosophical (and perhaps political) positions. But in just going through the dictionary understanding of -ist as a suffix, there’s a big broadening out. There are a bunch of words ending in -ist that aren’t “ISTS” in that sense. Like “twist” or “delist” and there’s been a pleasure in how kind of practical they are? Could also be a verb form thing that works well with games? Getting across to that Noun Verb Adjective design approach or whatever? Grammar-based design? Design language. Etc.

> Well, disgusting obviously. Can a Snake snake have a cist? You pop them. You don’t eat them. They can indicate that you’re not well or they can be benign. It’s also not an ist in the sense of ism, and I don’t want too many of those

### Design org

Ongoing theme of organizing my documents and thinking through how MDM works for this project

> - This session was helpful in that it includes design thinking in the new "prototypes" document where I'm reflecting specifically on prototyping work; but also the prototyping work itself
> - Is that a good thing, or not? It's nice that the commit has both at the same time maybe? A bit in conversation? Or would it have been better to do the work then reflect? Or reflect commit work commit reflect commit? I don't really know
> - Anyway, the act of prototyping and playing the real versions of a couple of these was really quite fun and made me happy, nice to switch from reading the dictionary for a bit
https://github.com/pippinbarr/SNAKISTS/commit/0eb1de80717a48f9b73f4eaacee55fb92859b2b4

### Small language

The idea that Snake is such a circumscribed language of play that you can't just say ANYTHING. THere's something funny about how easy it was to do mega philosophical concepts, but so much harder to do more concrete IST stuff?

> I think I'm running into some "helpful difficulties" around the sheer limits of the Snake universe; because I'm mostly trying to think in terms of minimally additive stuff, but a lot of ISTS (and all words) are understandably so far removed from what Snake world represents that it would take adding a lot of stuff to close the gap; which I think may contradict something wrote earlier about Snake being some kind of primitive Ur-language, haha
https://github.com/pippinbarr/SNAKISTS/commit/003ad65ef70a20e6b8882b444fdd18e9da57812d

> It's an example of a transformation of snake that I think is at least semi worthwhile in that it leans into a specific problem: the long body; and just starts with that as the premise - you need to move in a way that doesn't close off your exits... which is perfect for a heist
https://github.com/pippinbarr/SNAKISTS/commit/87f4ff0f03b3461aeac02d44b37dad3e18c497f9

Heist as a *fit* for Snake... the idea some games fit and some games don't?

> Prototyping activates different thought processes and attentions and one thing I keep being aware of is the level of “materiality” I guess I’m dealing with here which is not “implementing Snake variations in JavaScript” and not even “implementing Snake variations in Phaser 3” but “implementing Snake variations on top of my existing framework for Snake from Let’s Snake and before that SNAKISMS”.
https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISTS/process/journal.html#:~:text=Prototyping%20activates%20different,before%20that%20SNAKISMS%E2%80%9D.

> Which leads to very different kinds of thinking about what to do and how to do it - the framework literally has a spot to put extra after-death text for example, which encouraged me to think in that way; or just the idea of the definition screens still being built on the Snake class because it’s just easier to hide all the snake stuff and leave the words…
https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISTS/process/journal.html#:~:text=Which%20leads%20to,leave%20the%20words%E2%80%A6

> Have said this plenty of times, but good to keep it in mind. An obvious way to think of this whole project is that Snake presents you with a language (or play) and the process becomes about how the Snake-language can “say” or “define” the word in question. And one thing that happens is you do run into how limited the Snake language is… it can’t say everything, some of the things require adding or changing so much stuff it’s questionable to say it’s still Snake? So that kind of range of power… the question of where the borders are, the question of which words are easy/difficult to say in Snake feels… revealing? About Snake?
https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISTS/process/journal.html#:~:text=Have%20said%20this,revealing%3F%20About%20Snake%3F

> There’s a whole category of words that I want to be able to Snake but don’t have an idea right away. Like, say, Fascist. But this also makes me wonder… if there’s not an idea almost instantly, given how simple the Snake language is, does that mean… there’s no idea to be had? To what extent can you worry the bone of Snake until you make something fit into it? Or is the language so simple there’s not much to be done?
https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISTS/process/journal.html#:~:text=There%E2%80%99s%20a%20whole,to%20be%20done%3F

> There’s something in here about how you view/frame the materials of making for this. Most obviously it’s Snake. But you could also say “Snake as implemented in Snake.js”. Or “Snake as it exists in Pippin’s mind” (reflected in my Snake document?) But you could also say “Snake as in the entire game including the menu” at which point you get something like “delist” or one of my ideas for “persist”.

### Meta implementations

> Persist was fun because one of the ideas revolves around a more meta-level interpretation of it, which I appreciate (in the vein of delist)

### Love the process 

> Anyway, the listing of ists and just combing through them one at a time has been a really pleasant activity. Almost like a series of flash cards or actually those verb noun subject cards Rilla and I had where you just are shown some information and try to snap out a game idea. Feels like improv perhaps? Never done improv but I sure have ended up hearing a lot about it. Yes, and. Improv with yourself? (Is that a euphemism for masturbation?) Improv with the materials? (As distinct from conversation?)
https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISTS/process/journal.html#:~:text=Anyway%2C%20the%20listing,distinct%20from%20conversation%3F)

> I'm loving, in this moment, that this project amounts to READING THE DICTIONARY and designing games based on words you find. So basic, so effective, such a nice commentary on game design and the affordances of design with a pre-established game/play language.
https://github.com/pippinbarr/SNAKISTS/commit/f8f4c757e5a56554ef53f852c73368e1940e2066

> - The snake dies on the first tick because the world is full of matter
> - I mean, this is the good life right here
> - Let's not ask ourselves too rigorously whether this is also the research life... I want to be amused
https://github.com/pippinbarr/SNAKISTS/commit/7a435771ede08136dd19f4e4413004aae268c144

(Not just in terms of this is a good process, but the value of happiness in design)

> Felt good to pop out three today just here and there, keep it rolling... slithering...
https://github.com/pippinbarr/SNAKISTS/commit/c79403dc0fb344b423de6c76be4b208f2d95240c

> Feeling that feeling of "well, it would be quite nice to just finish this thing" so would like to accelerate
https://github.com/pippinbarr/SNAKISTS/commit/4d902986ff9479843f1b99765499a0a4e414a79d

But you also can't just love it... at a certain point you maybe just want to be done

> Came out pretty well, I'm happy that it got a bit funnier, though I'm not very amused by anything in this exact moment, too tired to laugh
https://github.com/pippinbarr/SNAKISTS/commit/bc1a604fe64ccb6d80385151e4709bca92d06ec4

As we see here

### If you build it you will see

> I enjoyed the surprise of what the screen looks like with many dead snakes all flashing in alternation
https://github.com/pippinbarr/SNAKISTS/commit/eb8e49c350fb6c90c9eeed7481d67b106ce02e52

> It's just what you would thing
https://github.com/pippinbarr/SNAKISTS/commit/8285d98c27b2e504482e4cb23bf099d1b87d0c7b

But also a lot of the time you just know? What does it mean to know?

### Paths not taken

I guess there's something to be said for the stories of game versions I took seriously and wanted to make but that didn't get in?

- Activist (never prototyped)
- Miniaturist (prototyped)
- Dadaist
- Diarist/Eulogist
- Epeeist/Duelist
- Tubaist/Feist
- Optometrist (tech failure)
