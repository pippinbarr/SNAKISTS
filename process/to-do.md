# To-dos

## Design

- Do not forget to review the #interesting tag in the [ists](./ists.md) document

## UI thinking

- **Did do this** ~~Should I pop definitions in somewhere, maybe after you select a level you see a definition, and then the game? Some of the ists are pretty confusing and I don't think it's all that interesting in this case to say the game defines them?~~

## Typist

- ~~Double-eat on space apple is a problem~~
- ~~Need to check if score still being affected by carriage return (think not)~~
- I did. Let's see. ~~Clear the text for the game over? Maybe not?~~

## Bugs

- Alarmist doesn't show gameover text and doesn't reset camera on death
