## Ists (2025-03-06)

Well, it begins. What am I doing? I'm avoiding working on other projects like a "game poem" and also the next step along the way of the *It is as if* projects. I'm doing that by making a sequel to SNAKISMS called SNAKISTS which allows me to do another suite of these stupid things with a slightly different flavour. Don't know what that flavour is yet... for now I literally thought it would be fun to use IST instead of ISM as the sequel indicator.

Let me list a bunch of ISTS and worry about them later:

(Taking these from a [scrabble dictionary](https://scrabble.merriam.com/words/end-with/ist) because it's what I found)

- nudist (default?)
- purist (default?)
- agist
- exist
- mist (fog of war)
- fist (boxing? snake as punch?)
- heist (robbing a bank?)
- assist (helping another snake?)
- sadist (surely?)
- tubist (tuba music and rhythm on tick)
- egoist
- insist
- typist
- artist
- cubist
- jurist
- atheist
- chemist
- dentist
- fascist
- lookist??
- narcicist
- onanist
- animist
- duelist
- elitist 
- persist
- baptist
- guitarist
- dadaist
- diarist
- egotist
- entwist
- florist
- ...

That's to the end of the 7-letter words anyway.

One thing that I find fun here is that unlike ISM, the IST ends up with a bunch of words that are *not* about philosophical positions because IST is just a more common suffix (e.g. persist), and you also end up with kind of quite negative words (agist, fascist)... these are less abstract and more forceful? Maybe they're harder or easier to turn into snakes?

As I wrote stuff down I confess I usually had no fucking idea of what to do for them, so let's not get too excited. But still this is at least a funny experiment for now.

## Organization; Chronological design?; Ist listing (2025-03-09)

### Organization

Spent my time on Friday morning moving away from "designing in the journal." Which strikes me as a whole thing to think about relative to MDM. Where design happens versus where reflection happens. And they're of course incredibly intertwined but at least for this project it has felt like it makes sense to have separate documentation of elements of the design process. Specifically there's now a separate [ists](./ists.md) list that just contains all the ists pulled from a Scrabble dictionary that I'm going through to check which ones lead to design ideas. And then there's a list of [candidates](./candidates.md) where I'm building up a list of the ideas that feel like I should at least prototype.

### Chronological design?

One thing about these two new (design) documents is that they're not (in themselves) chronological but rather... what... topical? Taxonomic? And as I'm writing this I realize how much I think of design as a chronology! As a passage through time with a person grappling with ideas and materials and figuring it out. Which seems like... an odd way to think about design perhaps. But that is for sure what seems natural... either because it's my brain or even because of the way I've traditionally kept a journal relative to design practice that makes it seem like design should/can be framed in terms of a passage of time.

This may merit further thought... there's more to this and I think it's important in the context of MDM.

### Ist listing

Anyway, the listing of ists and just combing through them one at a time has been a really pleasant activity. Almost like a series of flash cards or actually those verb noun subject cards Rilla and I had where you just are shown some information and try to snap out a game idea. Feels like improv perhaps? Never done improv but I sure have ended up hearing a lot about it. Yes, and. Improv with yourself? (Is that a euphemism for masturbation?) Improv with the materials? (As distinct from conversation?)

The process also reminds me a bit of PONGS which was epochal in terms of that idea of coming up with *lots* of (separate but related) designs, rather than trying to come up with "the design". SNAKISTS (and the others) is even "easier" in the sense that you don't need to generate the idea from nowhere but rather in reaction to a word, a definition. 

So yeah, it's a fun design exercise. As I write this I'm remembering that I was maybe walking somewhere and thought to myself I (or with someone else?) could write a design "textbook" that is, say, 10 exercises for design, premised on stuff I do "naturally". This would for sure be one of them. And the book could offer the exercise, resulting work, and get into the weeds a bit on the subtleties of how the exercise functions, how it relates to design as a practice, what aspects of your designerly practice it might shape, and so on. The bridge to it being relevant to game-y-game folks might be tough but might not be. (I'm being put in mind of Jon Sharp and Colleen Macklin's book here which I should check to see if it's somehow exactly what I'm proposing?)

(Though note how this would be a potential format/approach for MDM-based reasoning to be applied at the level of teaching design? Learn from the "master" ahahahaha)
