## Ists (2025-03-06)

Well, it begins. What am I doing? I'm avoiding working on other projects like a "game poem" and also the next step along the way of the *It is as if* projects. I'm doing that by making a sequel to SNAKISMS called SNAKISTS which allows me to do another suite of these stupid things with a slightly different flavour. Don't know what that flavour is yet... for now I literally thought it would be fun to use IST instead of ISM as the sequel indicator.

Let me list a bunch of ISTS and worry about them later:

(Taking these from a [scrabble dictionary](https://scrabble.merriam.com/words/end-with/ist) because it's what I found)

- nudist (default?)
- purist (default?)
- agist
- exist
- mist (fog of war)
- fist (boxing? snake as punch?)
- heist (robbing a bank?)
- assist (helping another snake?)
- sadist (surely?)
- tubist (tuba music and rhythm on tick)
- egoist
- insist
- typist
- artist
- cubist
- jurist
- atheist
- chemist
- dentist
- fascist
- lookist??
- narcicist
- onanist
- animist
- duelist
- elitist 
- persist
- baptist
- guitarist
- dadaist
- diarist
- egotist
- entwist
- florist
- ...

That's to the end of the 7-letter words anyway.

One thing that I find fun here is that unlike ISM, the IST ends up with a bunch of words that are *not* about philosophical positions because IST is just a more common suffix (e.g. persist), and you also end up with kind of quite negative words (agist, fascist)... these are less abstract and more forceful? Maybe they're harder or easier to turn into snakes?

As I wrote stuff down I confess I usually had no fucking idea of what to do for them, so let's not get too existed. But still this is at least a funny experiment for now.
